# Switching To Linux

Switching to Linux has been an incredible journey for me, and it's been full of valuable experiences and encounters with the Linux community. While it's true that the Linux community can be quite opinionated at times, especially among the Arch base enthusiasts, I've also found that it's a place where you can discover a wealth of knowledge and connect with people who are eager to help you learn and solve problems. This openness to sharing techniques and solutions has opened doors for me to delve deeper into technology.

I initially started with Manjaro, and, although it was a challenging choice, it pushed me to learn more. I came across a post that described Manjaro as being for 'smart people,' and that challenge motivated me. Eventually, I made the switch to Ubuntu, one of the most widely used Linux distributions. While it wasn't the perfect fit for me, I appreciated the vast amount of information and solutions available within the Ubuntu community, which accelerated my learning.

Currently, I'm using Fedora Silverblue, which I find fascinating because it allows me to interact with different Linux distributions in a single environment. Recently, I stumbled upon Universal Blue, a project by Jorge Castro, which I'm still learning about. However, after installing it, I noticed a significant boost in my computer's performance.

I owe my transition to Linux to two YouTubers: DistroTube and Chris Titus, who provided valuable insights and guidance throughout my journey. Their content was instrumental in helping me navigate the Linux landscape and discover new and exciting possibilities.
